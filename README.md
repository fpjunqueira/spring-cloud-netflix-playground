[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpjunqueira/spring-cloud-netflix-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpjunqueira/spring-cloud-netflix-skeleton)

A skeleton to support microservices projects based on spring cloud netflix.

The intention of this project is to provide with a help of Spring Cloud Netflix a basic configuration of the main communication patterns between micro-services such as API gateway (Zull), service discovery (Eureka), circuit breaker (Hystrix) and load balancer (Ribbon), as well as a configuration server module (Spring Cloud Config) and another module for authentication based on OAuth2.
